# CSS-Parallax-Show
Create the appearance of scrolling over images to transform from color to black and white. 
Images are assigned to be the background of two seperate divs 
(if you're just scrolling over something not changing you can simply set both divs to the same class). 
Fix the images and cover the background. Set the divs to fill 100% of the view height. 
Place an element between the divs to act as the 'scroll' representative. 
This can be chained with multiple images/layers to create more complex effects.
